## Instructions
Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold onto all of your work to
send to me at the end of the course.


## Discussion Questions:

### Unit 14 Discussion Post 1
Refer to your Unit 5 scan of the systems.
You know that Ansible is a tool that you want to maintain in the environment.

Review this online documentation:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html

1. Make an inventory of the servers, grouped any way you like.

2. What format did you choose to use for your inventory?

3. What other things might you include later in your inventory to make it more useful?

### Unit 14 Discussion Post 2
You have been noticing drift on your server configurations, so you want a way to 
generate a report on them every day to validate the configurations are the same.

Use any lab in here to find ideas:

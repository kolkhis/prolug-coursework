# Unit 2 Lab – Interacting with the Operating System

## Required Materials

- Putty or other connection tool
- Lab Server 
    - Killercoda recommended: <https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/AutomationLabs/Unit2_Interacting_with_OS> 
- Root or sudo command access


## LAB
This lab is designed to have the engineer verify and execute their automation tools to interact with the
OS in a controlled fashion.
If you do the killercoda Lab 2, just answer these questions. If you are doing the lab in the ProLUG
environment, find the scripts in /labs/automation/unit2.


### Lab Setup (ProLUG Lab Only)
```bash linenums="1"
cp -r /labs/automation/unit2/* /root
chmod 755 *.sh
chmor 755 *.py
```


### Bash Execution

1. Run the u2_script1.sh and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   /root/u2_script1.sh
   ```
   What are you shown?

2. Inspect the file and see if you can modify it to show the first 15 lines.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script1.sh
   ```
   Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.

3. Run the u2_script2.sh and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   /root/u2_script2.sh
   ```
   What happened in the script? Did it work correctly?
   ```bash
   ls -l /root
   ```

4. Inspect the file and see if you can make it use a different date format. You 
   may have to read the man pages for `date` command.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script2.sh
   ```
   As you’re interacting with the OS, are there any observations you have about how the scripts are set up,
   their structure and their output. Is there anything you would add for your scripts? If you would add
   something, how does it improve the code?


### Python execution

1. Run the u2_script1.py and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   /root/u2_script1.py
   ```
   What are you shown?

2. Inspect the file and see if you can modify it to show the first and last 15 lines.
    ```bash
    cat /root/u2_script1.py
    ```
    Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.

3. Run the u2_script2.py and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   /root/u2_script2.py
   ```
   What are you shown?

4. Inspect the file and see if you can make it use a different user shell, maybe one you've seen from
   other output in this lab.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script2.py
   ```

   Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.
   As you’re interacting with the OS, are there any observations you have about how the scripts are set up,
   their structure and their output. Is there anything you would add for your scripts? If you would add
   something, how does it improve the code?

### Ansible execution
1. Run the `u2_script1.yml` and look at what it shows you.
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook /root/u2_script1.yml
    ```
    What are you shown?

2. Inspect the file and see if you can modify it to show the first and last 15 lines.
    ```bash
    cat /root/u2_script1.yml
    ```
    Note: Modify with vi or vim. You may have to RTFM to continue.

3. Run the u2_script2.yml and look at what it shows you.
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook /root/u2_script2.yml
   ```
   What are you shown?

4. Inspect the file and see if you can make it name the file differently or populate different content.
   ```bash
   cat /root/u2_script2.yml
   ```
   Note: Modify with `vi` or `vim`. You may have to RTFM to continue.

5. Do one final `ls -l` against the `/root` directory.
    - What is a difference between the `.sh`, `.py`, and `.yml` files?
      ```bash
      ls -l
      ```

their structure and their output. Is there anything you would add for your scripts? If you would add

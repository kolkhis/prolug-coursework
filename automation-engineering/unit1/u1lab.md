### Python Execution

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. Test that you can import modules
   ```bash
   python3      # Will drop you into interactive shell
   import os    # Should work with no output
   import numpy # Should not work as you don’t have numpy on the system
   exit()       # Will exit the interactive python3 environment.
   ```

### Ansible Execution

2. Check other ansible tools
   ```bash
   ansible- <tab><tab>
   ```

   ansible-doc -l
   ansible-doc -l | wc -l
   ansible-doc -l | grep -i copy

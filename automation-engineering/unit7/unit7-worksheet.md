Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold your worksheets until
the end to turn them in as a final submission packet.


## Discussion Questions:

### Unit 7 Discussion Post 1
You are the team lead of a small Linux team maintaining 700
servers. Your management is always pushing for getting more from the systems and has
been asking you to explore container environments, especially in the cloud. You read some
blog posts about services and decide to write out your notes:
<https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-ecs-vs-amazon-eks-making-sense-of-aws-container-services/>

1. What are the major differences between container environments and Kubernetes 
   orchestrated environments?
   ```txt
   Container environments ffocus on packaging and running individual workloads.
   K8s orchesrated environments add a control plane that manages multiple
   containerized workloads at the same time. K8s environments are also
   self-healing and scalable, whereas container environments need to be managed
   a little more carefully.  
   ```

	- Why might you just want a containerized environment?  
      ```txt
      If you only have a single application that needs to run without relying
      on other external applications, or if you don't need automatic scaling for your 
      application, a containerized environment would be just fine.  
      ```

	- Why might you want an orchestrated environment?  
      ```txt
      An orchestrated environment would be preferable for running multiple
      applications or more complex applications that require the ability to
      dynamically scale and self-heal.  
      ```

	- Can you compare and contrast them?  
      ```txt
      Containerized environments have a singular purpose. K8s environments can
      have multiple purposes. K8s for a single application that requires no
      scaling would be like using a shotgun to go fishing.  
      ```

### Unit 7 Discussion Post 2
Your team is having problems with a deployment. This is the
code snippet they are using.

1. What is the provider they are using?
   ```txt
   They're using the kreuzwerker/docker provider, which is the standard
   provider used for Docker.  
   ```

2. How many docker instance are they trying to run, and what are their names?
   ```txt
   There are 3 instances they're spinning up with this terraform config.  
   There's nginx8080, nginx8081, and nginx8082.  
   All 3 instances are using the docker_image resource named "nginx".  
   ```
   
	- What ports are they going to be running on?
      ```txt
      8080, 8081, and 8082
      ```

3. Your team is having problems executing this and have brought it to you. What 
   might you check, or do with terraform to try to resolve the issue?
   ```txt
   I'd probably try to use `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` and see if the 
   config is valid first and foremost.  
   ```
	- If it’s telling you there are no providers?
      ```txt
      Use `terraform init` to download providers.
      ```
	- If it’s saying there’s a syntax problem (how can you find it)?
      ```txt
      Use `terraform validate` to check syntax
      ```
	- If there are no resources created?
      ```txt
      Use `terraform plan` to see what exactly the configuration will do.
      ```

```hcl
terraform {
	required_providers {
		docker = {
			source = "kreuzwerker/docker"
			version = "~> 2.13.0"
		}
	}
}

provider "docker" {}

resource "docker_image" "nginx" {
	name = "nginx:latest"
	keep_locally = false
}

resource "docker_container" "nginx8080" {
	image = docker_image.nginx.latest
	name = "nginx8080"
	ports {
		internal = 80
		external = 8080
	}
}
resource "docker_container" "nginx8081" {
	image = docker_image.nginx.latest
	name = "nginx8081"
	ports {
		internal = 80
		external = 8081
}
}
resource "docker_container" "nginx8082" {
	image = docker_image.nginx.latest
	name = "nginx8082"
	ports {
		internal = 80
		external = 8082
	}
}
```

## Lab and Assignment

Unit7 Lab Container Environments- https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Automation-Labs/Unit7_Container_Environments

## Digging Deeper

1. What are some of the best practices around container deployments?
https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/

1. Why might we not want to ever run the “latest” tag in production?
2. Why should an application be run as non-root?
3. What is it to be an immutable container?
4. What is it to be a sandboxed container?
	1. What does this mean from the kernel standpoint

## Reflection Questions
1. What questions do you still have about this week?
2. How are you going to use what you’ve learned in your current role?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Write Playbooks to Install Tools on Central VM %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Automating Monitoring with Ansible}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{I started by creating the central VM to host these tools:} 
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item{Prometheus }
                \item{Loki }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Grafana Playbook %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Grafana Setup Playbook}
The Grafana plabook was simple. It can be installed with most package managers after
    adding the repository.  
 
    Tasks:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Pull the Grafana GPG key.} 
        \item{Add the Grafana repository, signed by the GPG key.}
        \item{Install using the host OS's package manager.}
        \item{Add a task that starts/enables the Grafana-server systemd service.}
        \item{Use blocks with conditions to detect the OS family to determine where
            to store the GPG key and which package manager to use.}
            %whether to use either dnf/yum or apt.}
        \item{Expose port 3000 if firewalld is running.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Provisioning Data Sources and Dashboards}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Default dashboards and datasources can be stored in json format.}
        \item{Configure the data sources directly in yaml format in
            \texttt{/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources/} }
        \item{Configure the dashboards in json format, using a yaml config to 
                specify the path to the dashboard files in 
                \texttt{/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources/} }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Prometheus Playbook %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Prometheus Setup Playbook}
    Tasks:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Pull the tarball from Github.} 
        \item{Create necessary directories and user account.} 
        \item{Extract tarball into \texttt{/var/lib/prometheus} } 
        \item{Copy the binary and service files to their respective directories.} 
        \item{Create (or copy) some default configuration files.} 
        \item{Expose port 9090 if accessing externally.} 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Prometheus File-based Service Discovery %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}{Prometheus Service Discovery}
    Prometheus supports file-based service discovery.  
    To set it up:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Create a default \texttt{targets.json}} 
        \item{Add a \texttt{file\_sd\_configs} entry in \texttt{/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml}
            (Prometheus configuration file)} 
        \item{Point the \texttt{file\_sd\_configs} to your targets.json file.} 
        \item{Whenever a change is made in targets.json, Prometheus will detect the
            change and update accordingly.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Node Exporter Playbook %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\begin{frame}{Node Exporter Playbook}
    This process was similar to that of Prometheus.  
 
    Tasks:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Create user account for \texttt{node\_exporter}.} 
        \item{Download and extract the \texttt{node\_exporter} tarball.} 
        \item{Copy binary to \texttt{/usr/sbin}.} 
        \item{Copy service files to \texttt{/etc/systemd/system/}. } 
        \item{Read the contents of \texttt{targets.json} from the Prometheus node,
            add the new target, then write the changes.} 
        \item{If firewalld is running, expose port 9100. } 
        \item{Use \texttt{systemctl} to start/enable \texttt{node\_exporter}.} 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Node Exporter Targets %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Node Exporter Playbook, Pt2}
    Benefits of using file-based service discovery:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Every time this playbook deploys node\_exporter on a host, it adds 
            that host to targets.json (/etc/prometheus/target.json).} 
        \item{Prometheus will detect the change in this file and update.} 
        \item{This allows for dynamic updates of Prometheus scrape targets without
            having to restart the Prometheus service.} 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Appending to Targets.json %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Dynamically Adding Prometheus Targets}
    In order to append to the list of Prometheus targets, I had to read it in as a
    Python data structure.  
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Read in the contents of \texttt{targets.json} with the \texttt{slurp} module.} 
        \item{Decode the raw data. Slurp reads files in as a base64-encoded string.

            \texttt{targets\_file\_contents.content | b64decode | from\_json} } 

        \item{This is now a valid python data structure that can be manipulated. } 
        \item{Append it to the list like you normally would in python, formatted the
            way \texttt{json} likes.  }
              
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Writing Promtail/Loki playbooks %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Loki and Promtail Playbooks}
    These playbooks were written in the same way as the others.  \\
    Loki:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Pull the .zip file from GitHub.}
        \item{Extract it into /opt/loki with \texttt{ansible.builtin.unarchive}.}
        \item{Add a \texttt{loki.service} file and a \texttt{loki-local-config.yaml} file.}
    \end{enumerate} \\
    Promtail:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Pull the .zip file from GitHub.}
        \item{Make the /opt/promtail directory.}
        \item{Extract the zip file into /opt/promtail with \texttt{ansible.builtin.unarchive}.}
        \item{Add a \texttt{promtail.service} file and a \texttt{promtail-local-config.yaml} file.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%





%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Prometheus and node_exporter %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Prometheus and Node\_Exporter for System Metrics}
    Promtheus and Node\_Exporter are used for collecting and storing system metrics.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Node\_Exporter gathers system metrics and exposes them on an endpoint
            for Prometheus to scrape.}
        \item{Promtheus scrapes the metrics from targets in its configuration files and stores them.}
        \item{This data is then available for Grafana to display.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Loki and Promtail %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Loki and Promtail for Logging}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Loki and Promtail go together just like Prometheus and Node\_Exporter.  \\}
        \item{While Prometheus and Node\_Exporter are for gathering and storing system metrics,
            Loki and Promtail gather and store system logs.\\}
        \item{Loki is the TSDB, and Promtail collects the logs and sends them to Loki.\\}
        \item{This data is then available for Grafana to display.}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%% FRAME Loki and Promtail (cont) %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Loki and Promtail for Logging (cont.)}
    The way the data is transferred between Loki/Promtail is different from Prometheus/Node\_Exporter:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item{Prometheus/Node\_Exporter:} 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item{Node\_Exporter gathers and makes data available for scraping on the machine it's running on.} 
            \item{Prometheus goes and scrapes the logs that Node\_Exporter exposes.} 
        \end{enumerate}
        \item{Loki/Promtail:} 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item{Promtail actively gathers logs \textit{and} sends them to Loki.} 
            \item{Loki accepts the logs from Promtail and stores them.} 
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
    Promtail, like Prometheus, supports file-based service discovery. \\
    It works a bit differently, and I didn't use it in this project, but it exists.

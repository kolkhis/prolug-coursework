## Instructions
Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold onto all of your work to
send to me at the end of the course.


## Discussion Questions:

### Unit 13 Discussion Post 1
Your security team comes to you with a discrepancy between
the production security baseline and something that is running on one of your servers in
production. There are 5 servers in a web cluster and only one of them is showing this
behavior. They want you to account for why something is different.

1. How are you going to validate that the difference between the systems?

2. What are you going to look at to explain this?

3. What could be done to prevent this problem in the future?

### Unit 13 Discussion Post 2
Your team has been giving you more and more engineering
responsibilities. You are being asked to build out the next set of servers to integrate into the
development environment. Your team is going from RHEL 8 to Rocky 9.4.

1. How might you start to plan out your migration?

2. What are you going to check on the existing systems to baseline your build?

3. What kind of validation plan might you use for your new Rocky 9.4 systems?

## Instructions
Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold onto all of your work to
send to me at the end of the course.


## Discussion Questions:

### Unit 14 Discussion Post 1
Refer to your Unit 5 scan of the systems.
You know that Ansible is a tool that you want to maintain in the environment.

Review this online documentation:
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html

1. Make an inventory of the servers, grouped any way you like.

I looked into the ranges mentioned:
```bash
nmap -sP 192.168.200.100-254
```
Found 3 that responded:
* 192.168.100.101
* 192.168.100.102
* 192.168.100.103
```bash
nmap -A 192.168.200.101-103
```
* I found that these 3 hosts are running Ubuntu.  
* `101` and `102` both are exposing HTTP port `80/tcp`.  
    * They're also exposing `9080/tcp` which is listed as `glrpc` in `/etc/services`.  
    * Nmap guessed either Golang net/http server or InfluxDB API for these ports, and knowing a bit about the lab I'm assuming it's the latter.   
    * `9100` is exposed on all 3 of them. Printer port?  


Do the same for the other IPs:
```bash
nmap -A 192.168.200.25  # shows warewulf (already in /etc/hosts)
nmap -A 192.168.200.1   # shows a general purpose linux device with SSH open (Ubuntu)
```

Judging on the output of the `nmap` scans and prior knowledge of the lab,
here's the inventory file I've put together:
```ini
[rocky]
192.168.200.[50:69]

[ubuntu]
192.168.200.[101:103]
192.168.200.1

[warewulf]
192.168.200.25

[webservers]
192.168.200.[101:102]

[influx:children]
webservers

[all_servers:children]
rocky
ubuntu
warewulf
webservers
```

2. What format did you choose to use for your inventory?

I chose to use `.ini` format, using IP ranges instead of individual hostnames that
rely on either DNS or `/etc/hosts`. Though, in this case, all of the rocky boxes are
present in `/etc/hosts`

3. What other things might you include later in your inventory to make it more useful?

I will probably expand the list to include all the hostnames, when they become
available to me.  
I could run an ansible ad-hoc command using this inventory file to gather the hostnames to make the inventory file more detailed.  
```bash
ansible all_servers -i ./hosts.ini -m 'debug' -a 'msg="{{ ansible_hostname }} = {{ ansible_host }}"'
```


### Unit 14 Discussion Post 2
You have been noticing drift on your server configurations, so you want a way to 
generate a report on them every day to validate the configurations are the same.

Use any lab in here to find ideas: 
https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Ansible-Labs 

Use this webhook to send your relevant data out to our sandbox.
https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1317659221604433951/uyKpuq8fNNNSEyCra4n33PakIBk-XtTn1WrwTpHs9BcgkIu7URPV_Gd5HJCRX0_EJVUT

The best way to do this (imo) is to compare checksums of critical files to determine if changes were made, so that any probelms can be narrowed down to specific files. Critical services like `sshd` and `firewalld` should also be checked and compared. Checking for differences in installed packages could also be a good thing to do if all systems are meant to be identical.  
Ideally you'd want a baseline to test configurations against. E.g., file checksums for critical system files and configuration files.  
So this really would require 2 playbooks, a playbook to generate a baseline containing our "good" file checksums, and another playbook to check differences between the baseline and current state.  

---

I've been working on this all day. I'll post what I have.  

I ran into an error when trying to test these in the rocky environment. The SSH passwords werent' working because of fingerprints, so I used `ssh-keyscan` to gather the fingerprints and add them to the known hosts file.  
```
[root@rocky17 ansible_madness]# hostname -I
192.168.200.67
[root@rocky17 ansible_madness]# for host in {51..69}; do if [ ! $host == 67 ]; then ssh-keyscan -H 192.168.200.$host >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts; fi; done
```
BUT, the problem was that I didn't have the correct login credentials for these boxes. I'm assuming the only way to connect to these via ssh is through the jumpbox.  

I tried testing these against the Ubuntu boxes, but of course the packages were going to be all out of wack.  
So, I'm going to leave this here for now and maybe set up my own environment where I can test these properly. 
I have a playbook to generate a baseline here:

Basically, the premise here... All things being equal, I generate two yaml files formatted exactly the same, with entries containing dictionaries and lists. A `files` dictionary with filenames as keys with sha256 hashes as values, a `services` dictionary containing the name of services as keys, and the state of services as values, and then a list of installed packages. I load them in with slurp, parse them with `b64decode` and `from_yaml`, I then use the `difference` filter to output any changes. Those would be what's reported.

https://github.com/Kolkhis/scripts-playbooks/tree/main/playbooks/drift_report

This playbook is to generate a drift report. I hadn't gotten to the "send data back"
point, because I couldn't collect the data. But, I'll get there.

### Unit 14 Discussion Post 3
Using ansible module for git, pull down this repo:
https://github.com/het-tanis/HPC_Deploy.git

```yaml
- name: Pull down the repo
  ansible.builtin.git
    url: https://github.com/het-tanis/HPC_Deploy.git
    dest: ~/prolug-linux-sysadmin/
```

1. How is the repo setup?

It has basic playbook that conditionally include roles. 
There's a directory for both roles and reports.  


2. What is in the roles directory?

Roles, with directories in each for tasks, handlers, and templates.  
In the `tasks` directories, there is a file called `main.yml` that contains all the tasks for that role.


3. How are these playbooks called, and how do roles differ from tasks?

These playbooks include roles when conditions are met, which execute the tasks inside each of the roles.  
When a role is included, the playbook inherits everything inside the role.  



## Definitions/Terminology
- Automation: The act of taking a repetitive task and writing instructions to repeat it automatically, to reduce the need for manual intervention.

- Consistency: The ability to perform the same task or set of instructions across multiple systems without any variation. 

- Dev/Ops: Development/Operations. The point between software development and
  operations teams, streamlining software development, deployment, and maintenance.  
    * It's a methodology which integrates and automates the work of software development.
    * Specifically, on the operations side where environments are set up, configured, and deployed.  

- Timelines: A period of time that you have to complete a task.  
    * Performing tasks or updates quickly and reliably, to ensure systems remain
      current and secure.

- Git: A version control tool, the most popular one.
    * It's used to track changes in files and directories, stores all changes and
      previous versions of the files so that you can roll back if you need to.  

- Repository: A centralized storage location where you store a version-controlled project.  
    * Repositories can be local or remote.  
    * Remote repositories are hosted on cloud platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).  

- Ad-hoc: One-liners executed directly, without running a whole playbook.  
    * Used for quick, one time tasks like checking uptime or restarting services.  

- Playbook: A `yaml` file that contains a set of instructions for Ansible.  
    * Made up of a series of tasks, and optionally roles.  

- Task: A single set of instructions within a playbook. Uses an ansible module with arguments to achieve a specific outcome.  

- Role: A reusable/modular way to organize playbooks, tasks, variables, and templates in Ansible.  
    * A role can be included in any playbook, and that playbook will inherit
      everything inside of the role.  
    * A role has a directory structure to separate all of its components.  
    * E.g., Create a role with `ansible-galaxy init my_role` and it will
      generate a new directory with these subdirectories:
        * `tasks/`: Where you define the main tasks for the role.  
        * `handlers/`: Define handlers that are triggered with `notify` in `tasks`.  
        * `templates/`: Store `Jinja2` templates for dynamically generating files.  
        * `files/`: Store static files that can be copied to remote hosts.  
        * `vars/`: Define variables that are specific to the role.  
        * `defaults/`: Define default values for variables (these have the lowest precedence).  
        * `meta/`: Include metadata about the role, like depenencies.  

- SSH (Secure SHell): A protocol used to securely log in with a shell to a remote system.   
    * Ansible relies on SSH to connect to Linux/Unix systems. 

- WinRM (Windows Remote Management): A protocol used to manage and communicate with Windows systems remotely.  
    * Ansible uses WinRM for accessing Windows machines.

### Pre-Lab Warm-Up

Exercises (Warmup to quickly run through your system and practice commands)

1. `mkdir lab_users`
2. `cd /lab_users`
3. `cat /etc/passwd`
    * We'll be examining the contents of this file later
4. `cat /etc/passwd | tail -5`
    * What did this do to the output of the file?
5. `cat /etc/passwd | tail -5 | nl`
6. `cat /etc/passwd | tail -5 | awk -F : ‘{print $1, $3, $7}'`
    * What did that do and what do each of the `$#` represent?
    * Can you give the 2nd, 5th, and 6th fields?
7. `cat /etc/passwd | tail -5 | awk –F : ‘{print $NF}'`
    * What does this `$NF` mean? Why might this be useful to us as administrators?
8. `alias`
    * Look at the things you have aliased.
    * These come from defaults in your `.bashrc` file. We'll configure these later
9. `cd /root`
10. `ls -l`
11. `ll`
    * Output should be similar.  
12. `unalias ll`
13. `ll`
    * You shouldn't have this command available anymore.  
14. `ls`
15. `unalias ls`
    * How did `ls` change on your screen?

No worries, there are two ways to fix the mess you've made.
Nothing you've done is permanent, so logging out and reloading a shell (logging back in) would fix this.  
We just put the aliases back.  

16. `alias ll='ls -l --color=auto'`
17. `alias ls='ls --color=auto'`
    * Test with `alias` to see them added and also use `ll` and `ls` to see them work properly.

### Lab🧪
This lab is designed to help you get familiar with the basics of the systems you will be working on.

Some of you will find that you know the basic material but the techniques here allow 
you to put it together in a more complex fashion.

It is recommended that you type these commands and do not copy and paste them.
Browsers sometimes like to format characters in a way that doesn't always play nice with Linux.


#### The Shadow password suite:

There are 4 files that comprise of the shadow password suite. We'll investigate them a bit and look at
how they secure the system. The four files are `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`, `/etc/shadow`, and `/etc/gshadow`.  

1. Look at each of the files and see if you can determine some basic information about them
   ```bash
   more /etc/passwd
   more /etc/group
   more /etc/shadow
   more /etc/gshadow
   ```
   
   There is one other file you may want to become familiar with:
   ```bash
   more /etc/login.defs
   ```
   
   Check the file permissions:
   ```bash
   ls –l /etc/passwd
   ```
   Do this for each file to see how their permissions are set.
   
   You may note that `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` are readable by everyone on the system
   but `/etc/shadow` and `/etc/gshadow` are not readable by anyone on the system.


2. Anatomy of the `/etc/passwd` file
   `/etc/passwd` is broken down like this, a `:` (colon) delimited file:
   
   | Username | Password | User ID (UID) | Group ID (GID) | User Info | Home Directory | Login Shell |
   |----------|----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
   | `puppet` |    `x`   |    `994`      |     `991`      | `Puppet server daemon` | `/opt/puppetlabs/server/data/puppetserver` | `/sbin/nologin` |
    * `cat` or `more` the file to verify these are values you see.  
    * Are there always 7 fields?

3. Anatomy of the `/etc/group` file
   `/etc/group` is broken down like this, a `:` (colon) delimited file:  
   
   | Groupname | Password | Group  ID | Group Members
   |-----------|----------|-----------|---------------
   | `puppet`  |    `x`   | `991`     | `foreman, foreman-proxy`

    * `cat` or `more` the file to verify these are the values you see. Are there always 4 fields?

4. We're not going to break down the `g` files, but there are a lot of resources online that
  can show you this same information.
  Suffice it to say, the passwords, if they exist, are stored in
  an md5 digest format up to RHEL 5. RHEL 6,7,8 and 9 use SHA-512 hash.
  We cannot allow these to be read by just anyone because then they could brute force 
  and try to figure out our passwords.

    ### Creating and modifying local users:
    We should take a second to note that the systems you're using are tied into our active directory with
    Kerberos. You will not be seeing your account in `/etc/passwd`, as that authentication is occurring
    remotely. You can, however, run `id <username>` to see user information about yourself that you have
    according to active directory.
    Your `/etc/login.defs` file is default and contains a lot of the values that control how our next commands
    work

5. Creating users
   ```bash
   useradd user1
   useradd user2
   useradd user3
   ```
   Do a quick check on our main files:
   ```bash
   tail -5 /etc/passwd
   tail –5 /etc/shadow
   ```
   What `UID` and `GID` were each of these given? Do they match up?
   Verify your users all have home directories. Where would you check this?
   ```bash
   ls /home
   ```
   Your users `/home/<username>` directories have hidden files that were all pulled from a
   directory called `/etc/skel`. If you wanted to test this and verify you might do something like
   this:
   ```bash
   cd /etc/skel
   vi .bashrc
   ```
   Use `vi` commands to add the line:
   ```bash
   alias dinosaur='echo "Rarw"'
   ```
   Your file should now look like this:
   ```bash
   # .bashrc
   # Source global definitions
   if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
   . /etc/bashrc
   fi
   alias dinosaur='echo "Rarw"'
   # Uncomment the following line if you don't like systemctl's auto-paging feature:
   # export SYSTEMD_PAGER=
   # User specific aliases and functions
   ```
   Save the file with `:wq`.
   ```bash
   useradd user4
   su - user4
   dinosaur #should roar out to the screen
   ```

   Doing that changed the `.bashrc` file for all new users that have home directories created on the server.
   An old trick, when users mess up their login files (all the `.` files), is to move them all to a
   directory and pull them from `/etc/skel` again.
   If the user can log in with no problems, you know the problem was something they created.

   We can test this with the same steps on an existing user.
   Pick an existing user and verify they don't have that command
   ```bash
   su – user1
   dinosaur #command not found
   exit
   ```
   Then, as root:
   ```bash
   cd /home/user1
   mkdir old_dot_files
   mv .* old_dot_files #ignore the errors, those are directories
   cp /etc/skel/.* /home/user1 #ignore the errors, those are directories
   su – user1
   dinosaur #should roar now because the .bashrc file is new from /etc/skel
   ```

6. Creating groups
   From our `/etc/login.defs` we can see that the default range for UIDs on this system, when created by
   `useradd` are:
   ```bash
   UID_MIN 1000
   UID_MAX 60000
   ```
   So an easy way to make sure that we don't get confused on our group numbering is to ensure we create
   groups outside of that range.
   This isn't required, but can save you headache in the future. 
   ```bash
   groupadd –g 60001 project
   tail -5 /etc/group
   ```
   You can also make groups the old fashioned way by putting a line right into the `/etc/group` file.  
   Try this:
   ```bash
   vi /etc/group
   ```
    * Shift+G to go to the bottom of the file.  
    * Hit `o` to create a new line and go to insert mode.
    * Add `project2:x:60002:user4`
    * Hit `Esc`
    * `:wq!` to write quit the file explicit force because it's a read only file.  
   ```bash
   id user 4 #Should now see the project2 in the user's groups
   ```
  

7. Modifying or deleting users
   So maybe now we need to move our users into that group.
   ```bash
   usermod –G project user4
   tail –f /etc/group #Should see user4 in the group
   ```
   But, maybe we want to add more users and we want to just put them in there:
   ```bash
   vi /etc/group
   ```
    * `Shift+G` Will take you to the bottom.  
    * Hit `i` (will put you into insert mode).  
    * Add `,user1,user2` after `user4`.  
    * Hit `Esc`.  
    * `:wq` to save and exit.  
   Verify your users are in the group now
   ```bash
   id user4
   id user1
   id user2
   ```

8. Test group permissions
   I included the permissions discussion from an earlier lab because it's important to see how
   permissions affect what user can see what information.  

   Currently we have `user1,2,4` belonging to group `project` but not `user3`. So we will verify these
   permissions are enforced by the filesystem.  
   ```bash
   mkdir /project
   ls –ld /project
   chown root:project /project
   cmod 775 /project
   ls –ld /project
   ```

   If you do this, you now have a directory `/project` and you've changed the group ownership to `/project`.
   You've also given group `project` users the ability to write into your directory.
   Everyone can still read from your directory.
   Check permissions with users:
   ```bash
   su – user1
   cd /project
   touch user1
   exit
   su – user3
   cd /project
   touch user3
   exit
   ```

   Anyone not in the `project` group doesn't have permissions to write a file into that directory.
   Now, as the root user:
   ```bash
   chmod 770 /project
   ```

   Check permissions with users:
   ```bash
   su – user1
   cd /project
   touch user1.1
   exit
   su – user3
   cd /project # Should break right about here
   touch user3
   exit
   ```
   You can play with these permissions a bit, but there's a lot of information online to help you
   understand permissions better if you need more resources.

#### Working with permissions:
Permissions have to do with who can or cannot access (read), edit (write), or execute (xecute)files.
Permissions look like this:
```bash
ls –l
```
| Permission | Number of hard links | UID Owner | Group Owner | Size in bytes | Creation Month | Creation Day| Creation Time (H:M) | Name of File
|------------|----------------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------
| `-rw-r--r--.` | `1` | `scott` | `domain_users`| `58` | `Jun` | `22` | `08:52` | `datefile`

The primary permissions commands we're going to use are going to be `chmod` (access) and `chown` (ownership).

A quick rundown of how permissions break out.
I will explain this on the call.

Let's examine some permissions and see if we can't figure out what permissions are allowed
```bash
ls -ld /home/scott/
drwx------. 5 scott domain_users 4096 Jun 22 09:11 /home/scott/
```
The first character lets you know if the file is a directory, file, or link. In this case we are looking at my home directory.
* `rwx`: For UID (me). 
    - What permissions do I have?
* `---`: For group. 
    - Who are they? 
    - What can my group do?
* `---`: For everyone else.
    - What can everyone else do?

Go find some other interesting files or directories and see what you see there.
Can you identify their characteristics and permissions?

## Instructions  
Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. 

## Discussion Questions:  

### Unit 1 Discussion Post 1:
Think about how week 1 went for you.  
1.	Do you get everything you needed to done?  

2.	Do you need to allocate more time to the course, and if so, how do you plan to do it?  

3.	How well did you take notes during the lecture? Do you need to improve this?  
 

### Unit 1 Discussion Post 2: 
Read a blog, check a search engine, or ask an AI about SELINUX.  
What is the significance of contexts? What are the significance of labels?

Scenario:  
You follow your company instructions to add a new user to a set of 10 Linux servers.  
They cannot access just one (1) of the servers.  
When you review the differences in the servers you see that the server they cannot access is running SELINUX.  
On checking other users have no problem getting into the system.  
You find nothing in the documentation (typical) about this different system or how these users are accessing it.  
What do you do? Where do you check? (you may use any online resources to help you answer this.  
This is not a trick and it is not a “one answer solution”.  
This is for you to think through.)  


## Definitions/Terminology  

- Uptime: 
- Standard input (stdin): 
- Standard output (stdout): 
- Standard error (stderr): 
- Mandatory Access Control (MAC): 
- Discretionary Access Control (DAC): 
- Security contexts (SELINUX): 
- SELINUX operating modes: 


## Notes During Lecture/Class:  
### Links:  

### Terms:  

### Useful tools:  


## Lab and Assignment  
Unit2_ProLUG_LabEssentials2 - To be completed outside of lecture time  
	Compare SELINUX to Apparmor, following the below 2 tasks: 
a.	Read this article: https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/apparmor-selinux-isolation  
b.	Do this lab: https://killercoda.com/killer-shell-cks/scenario/apparmor

Start thinking about your project ideas (more to come in future weeks):  
		Topics:  
1.	System Stability  
2.	System Performance  
3.	System Security  
4.	System monitoring  
5.	Kubernetes  
6.	Programming/Automation  

You will research, design, deploy, and document a system that improves your 
administration of Linux systems in some way.

## Digging Deeper  

1.	How does troubleshooting differ between system administration and system engineering? To clarify, how might you troubleshoot differently if you know a system was running v. if you’re building a new system out?  

2.	Investigate a troubleshooting methodology, by either google or AI search.  
    Does the methodology fit for you in an IT sense, why or why not?  

## Reflection Questions  

1.	What questions do you still have about this week?  

2.	How are you going to use what you’ve learned in your current role?

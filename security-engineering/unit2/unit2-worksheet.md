#### Discussion Post #1

There are 401 stigs for RHEL 9. If you filter in your STIG viewer for
`sysctl` there are 33 (mostly network focused), ssh - 39, and network - 58. Now there are
some overlaps between those, but review them and answer these questions

1. As systems engineers why are we focused on protecting the network portion of our
   server builds?

> The network portion of the server builds is one of the most important
> components of security.
> Almost all attacks will come from the outside, meaning an attacker will need to find 
> vulnerabilities in the network setup of the server. 
> We can't just keep everything closed, since we need our machines to be
> accessible, but by implementing a deny-all and allow-by-exception policy on our 
> firewalls, we have ultimate control over what is allowed in and out of the server.
> If we harden the network, we make it that much harder for attackers to
> get in and do damage to the org. 

2. Why is it important to understand all the possible ingress points to our servers that
   exist?

>  This is important because every single ingress point in the server is a potential
>  attack vector. Understanding all possible ingress points allows us to implement
>  the best preventative controls we know of to ensure that we minimize the attack 
>  surface of all of the ingress points. SSH is a common one. The STIGs mentioned
>  include implementing publickey authentication, a good practice since we'd need
>  access to the box to begin with in order to add a public key.  


   - Why is it so important to understand the behaviors of processes that are
     connecting on those ingress points?

>  In the same vein, processes that connect to the ingress points are also
>  potential attack vectors. If we're letting a process into one of our
>  servers, we need to understand the risk associated with that process. If
>  the process itself has attack vectors, those could be exploited to
>  indirectly gain access to the system. If we understand the normal behavior
>  of those processes, we will recognize when the process is acting unusual.
>  For instance, going back to the STIGs mentioned, knowing the default behavior of SSH 
>  will allow us to recognize when an SSH connection becomes unresponsive -- allowing us 
>  to terminate unresponsive SSH connections to avoid hijacking and minimize resource usage

#### Discussion Post #2

Read this: <https://ciq.com/blog/demystifying-and-troubleshooting-name-resolution-in-rocky-linux/>
or similar blogs on DNS and host file configurations.

1. What is the significance of the `nsswitch.conf` file?

2. What are security problems associated with DNS and common exploits? (May have
   to look into some more blogs or posts for this)

## Definitions

---

* `sysctl`: A tool used to control kernel modules.

* `nsswitch.conf`: The `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file is is the configuration file for the Name Switch Service.
    - The Name Switch Service specifies the order in which name service databases are 
      queried for certain information, like user accounts and hostnames.
    - It allows the system to determine where to look for this information: local files, 
      DNS (Domain Name System), or network services like NIS and LDAP.
    - <https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nsswitch.conf.5.html>
    - The first column in this file is the database name.  
    - The next columns specify service specifications.
        - `files`, `db`, or `nis`
        - Optional actions to perform is a result is obtained from the previous service.
    <!-- TODO: Break down each column of each line in this file -->

* DNS: Domain Name System - Resolves human-friendly domain names into IP addresses.  
    - The "phonebook of the internet"
    - 

* OpenSCAP:

* CIS Benchmarks:

* `ss`/`netstat`: Tools on Linux systems for monitoring network activity on the system.
    - `ss` is mainly for finding out what ports are open, and what services are using
      them.  
    - `netstat` shows network connections, routing tables, network interface stats,
      among other things.  

* `tcpdump`: Tool used to monitor packets on a network interface. 
    -

* `ngrep`:

## Digging Deeper

---

1. See if you can find any DNS exploits that have been used and written up in the
   diamond model of intrusion analysis format. If you can, what are the primary actors
   and actions that made up the attack?

## Reflection Questions

---

1. What questions do you still have about this week?

2. How are you going to use what you've learned in your current role?

#### Discussion Post #1

There are 401 stigs for RHEL 9. If you filter in your STIG viewer for
`sysctl` there are 33 (mostly network focused), ssh - 39, and network - 58. Now there are
some overlaps between those, but review them and answer these questions

1. As systems engineers why are we focused on protecting the network portion of our
   server builds?

> The network portion of the server builds is one of the most important
> components of security.
> Almost all attacks will come from the outside, meaning an attacker will need to find 
> vulnerabilities in the network setup of the server. 
> We can't just keep everything closed, since we need our machines to be
> accessible, but by implementing a deny-all and allow-by-exception policy on our 
> firewalls, we have ultimate control over what is allowed in and out of the server.
> If we harden the network, we make it that much harder for attackers to
> get in and do damage to the org. 

2. Why is it important to understand all the possible ingress points to our servers that
   exist?

>  This is important because every single ingress point in the server is a potential
>  attack vector. Understanding all possible ingress points allows us to implement
>  the best preventative controls we know of to ensure that we minimize the attack 
>  surface of all of the ingress points. SSH is a common one. The STIGs mentioned
>  include implementing publickey authentication, a good practice since we'd need
>  access to the box to begin with in order to add a public key.  


   - Why is it so important to understand the behaviors of processes that are
     connecting on those ingress points?

>  In the same vein, processes that connect to the ingress points are also
>  potential attack vectors. If we're letting a process into one of our
>  servers, we need to understand the risk associated with that process. If
>  the process itself has attack vectors, those could be exploited to
>  indirectly gain access to the system. If we understand the normal behavior
>  of those processes, we will recognize when the process is acting unusual.
>  For instance, going back to the STIGs mentioned, knowing the default behavior of SSH 
>  will allow us to recognize when an SSH connection becomes unresponsive -- allowing us 
>  to terminate unresponsive SSH connections to avoid hijacking and minimize resource usage

#### Discussion Post #2

Read this: <https://ciq.com/blog/demystifying-and-troubleshooting-name-resolution-in-rocky-linux/>
or similar blogs on DNS and host file configurations.

1. What is the significance of the `nsswitch.conf` file?

> The `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file is responsible for determining the order in which
> sources are used to resolve names and look up information, such as:
> - Hostname resolution
> - Users and groups information (`passwd`, `group`)
> - Authentication mechanisms
> - Network service entries, etc  
> The file acts as a priority list for where the system should look first, second,
> third, and so on.  
> 
> Example from a rocky linux box:
> ```ini
> passwd:     files sss systemd
> group:      files sss systemd
> netgroup:   sss files
> automount:  sss files
> services:   sss files
> ```
> Each entry follows the same kind of procedure:
> - `passwd:   files sss systemd`
>     - `files` Says to look in `/etc/passwd` for user account info first
>     - `sss`: Then query the SSSD (System Security Services Daemon), typically used with LDAP or FreeIPA
>     - `systemd`: Finally check the systemd user database (for runtime or transient user accounts)
> 
> This file is significant in that a misconfigured `nsswitch.conf` can cause a lot of 
> damage. If not properly configured, it could lead to slow lookups, offline failures 
> (like if DNS is unreachable and there's no local fallback), or incorrect name resolutions. 
> Because name resolution is used inm almost every system call (`ssh`, `ping`, `yum`,
> etc.), a misconfigured `nsswitch.conf` can lead to a lot of issues.


2. What are security problems associated with DNS and common exploits? (May have
   to look into some more blogs or posts for this)

> DNS is a foundational network service, which makes it critical to network security.
> Some common DNS security problems include:
> - DNS spoofing (cache poisoning): Injecting false DNS records into a DNS resolver's 
>   cache to return a bad response, usually to redirect users to malicious domains (like phishing sites).  
> - DNS amplification attacks: A form of DDoS that comes from small requests
>   to publicly available DNS servers with a spoofed source IPs to target open DNS 
>   resolvers. The response is much *larger* than the initial request (amplified).  
>   - Potential mitigation for this is to disable open recursive resolvers, use rate limiting, and response filtering  
> - DNS tunneling: Data exfiltration via DNS. An attacker would encode data into DNS
>   queries and use them to exfiltrate data.  
> - NXDOMAIN Attacks: Sending queries for non-existent domains to the DNS server,
>   causing server overload and potential DoS.  
> - DNS Hijacking: Diverting DNS query traffic to a malicious DNS server to lead users
>   to malicious websites.  
> - Typosquatting and homograph attacks: When you come across similar looking domain names (`goog1e.com`). Not necessarily a DNS thing but it seems related.

## Definitions

---

* `sysctl`: A tool used to manage kernel runtime parameters.
    - Check on all the kernel runtime parameters with `-a`:
      ```bash
      sysctl -a
      # Filter for ipv4
      sysctl -a | grep -i 'ipv4'
      ```
    - Search for specific settings by passing names directly.
      ```bash
      sysctl net.ipv4
      ```
      This will query the `/proc/sys` directory for subdirectories with these names.  
      E.g., `net.ipv4` will look for `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/` and show all settings in
      there.  
    - Adding or changing runtime rules can be done directly.  
      ```bash
      sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=0 # disable ipv4 forwarding
      ```
      But this change won't persist, it will only affect the runtime configuration.  
      Permanent changes should be added in `/etc/sysctl.d/99-somefile.conf`.  
    - If adding permanent changes to `/etc/sysctl.d`, you need to reload kernel
      runtime parameters before the new ones take effect.  
      ```bash
      sysctl --system  # applies all files under /etc/sysctl.d/
      ```
      Or, to only apply a single file:
      ```bash
      sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-somefile.conf  # -p (--load) only applies this file
      ```

* `nsswitch.conf`: The `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file is is the configuration file for the Name Switch Service.
    - The Name Switch Service specifies the order in which name service databases are 
      queried for certain information, like user accounts and hostnames.
    - It allows the system to determine where to look for this information: local files, 
      DNS (Domain Name System), or network services like NIS and LDAP.
    - <https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/nsswitch.conf.5.html>
    - The first column in this file is the database name.  
    - The next columns specify service specifications.
        - `files`, `db`, `systemd`, `sss`, or `nis`
        - Optional actions to perform if a result is obtained from the previous service.
    <!-- TODO: Break down each column of each line in this file -->

* DNS: Domain Name System - Resolves human-friendly domain names into IP addresses.  
    - The "phonebook of the internet".

* OpenSCAP: A collection of open source tools for implementing and enforcing SCAP standards.  
    - SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a US standard that comes from
      NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology).  

* CIS Benchmarks: Security guidelines and best practices for securing a system from
  the Center for Internet Security (CIS).  
    - These benchmarks provide recommendations for system hardening and are a widely 
      recognized industry standard.  
    - Used by businesses and government organizations to assess/improve their security posture.  

* `ss`/`netstat`: Tools on Linux systems for monitoring network activity on the system.
    - `ss` is mainly for finding out what ports are open, and what services are using
      them.  
    - `netstat` shows network connections, routing tables, network interface stats,
      among other things.  

* `tcpdump`: Tool used to monitor packets on a network interface. 
    - Used to inspect traffic on a network interface.
    - You can write (`-w`) the output to a file for logging, or read (`-r`) packet info from a file.  
    - Packets can be filtered by an expression (as specified in `man 7 pcap-filter`).  

* `ngrep`: (Network Grep) Network layer grep tool.  
    - Allows for extended regex matches against data payloads in packets.  
    - Supports TCP, UDP, and ICMP (ethernet). 
    - Supports PPP, SLIP, FDDI, and null interfaces.  
    - Understands bpf filter logic just like packet sniffing tools (e.g., `tcpdump`, `snoop`).  

## Digging Deeper

---

1. See if you can find any DNS exploits that have been used and written up in the
   diamond model of intrusion analysis format. If you can, what are the primary actors
   and actions that made up the attack?

## Reflection Questions

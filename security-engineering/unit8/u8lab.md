# Unit 8 Lab - Configuration Drift and Remediation

> If you are unable to finish the lab in the ProLUG lab environment we ask you `reboot`
> the machine from the command line so that other students will have the intended environment.

### Required Materials

Putty or other connection tool Lab Server

Root or sudo command access

STIG Viewer 2.18 (download from <https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/> )

## Lab üß™

These labs focus on configuration drift tracking and remediation.

### Operational Activities

![Image 1](./assets/images/u8/image1.jpeg)

1. Check your stig viewer and go to RHEL 9 stigs.

2. Set a filter for ‚Äúchange management‚Äù.

   - How many STIGs do you see?

3. Review the wording, what is meant by a robust change management process?
   - Do you think this can be applied in just one STIG? Why or why not?
   - What type of control is being implemented with change management in these STIGS?
     - Is it different across the STIGs or all the same?

### Monitoring configuration drift with Aide

1. Go into the sandbox lab: <https://killercoda.com/playgrounds/scenario/ubuntu>

2. Install aide and watch the installation happen.

   ```bash
   apt -y install aide
   ```
   - What is being put in the path /etc/aide/aide.conf.d/ ?
        - Configuration files for AIDE (for different services)
     - How many files are in there?
        - 213 files.

3. Check your version of aide

   ```bash
   aide -v
   ```

4. Read the man page (first page).

   - What does aide try to do, and how does it do it?

        > - It attempts to verify file integrity.
          It does this by using a database to store file hashes, then checking the
          current hashes of the file against the hashes stored in its database. 
        > - Stands for Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment. It checks the integrity of the
          files by hashing all of the files, and then keeping a database of all the hashes for 
          those files.  

5. What is the configuration of cron found in `/etc/cron.daily/dailyaidecheck`?

   - What does this attempt to do?
   - What checks are there before execution?
   - Read the man for `capsh`, what is it used for?

6. Set up aide according to the default configuration

   ```bash
   time aide -i -c /etc/aide/aide.conf
   ```
   - How long did that take?
        > - 4 minutes nad 14 seconds
        ```bash
        real    4m14.839s
        user    3m30.362s
        sys     0m8.712s
        ```
     - How much time was wall clock v. system/user time?
        > - User time was 44 seconds less than wall clock time. System time was only 8 seconds

     - Why might you want to know this on your systems?
     - What do you notice about the output?
       1. What do you need to go read about?

![Image 2](./assets/images/u8/image2.jpeg)

(Mine took 5 minutes 8 seconds to run on the lab system)

7. Set the database up properly

   ```bash
   cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db
   ```

8. Test aide by making files in a tracked directory

   ```bash
   mkdir /root/prolug
   touch /root/prolug/test1
   touch /root/prolug/test2
   time aide -c /etc/aide/aide.conf --check
   ```
     - Did you see your new files created?
        > - Yes, under the "Added entries" section.  
     - How long did this take to run?
        > - 6 minutes and 38 seconds
        ```bash
        End timestamp: 2025-05-18 01:06:19 +0000 (run time: 6m 39s)

        real    6m38.765s
        user    5m54.272s
        sys     0m8.283s
        ```

       1. What type of usage do you see against user/system space?
            > - Again, the user time was about 45 seconds less than wall time.
            >   The system time was also 8 seconds (like the last timed cmd).

### Using Ansible to fix drift

1. Complete the lab here: 
   <https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Ansible-Labs/16-Ansible-Web-Server-Env-Deploy>

2. When you finish ensure that you see broken output for 8081, as required.

   ```bash
   curl node01:8080
   ```

3. One of the dev teams figured out they could modify the test and qa environments because a
   previous engineer left them in the sudoers file. You can address that separately with 
   the security team, but for now you need to get those environments back to working. 
   Run your original deployment command to see if it sets the environment back properly.

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i /root/hosts/root/web_environment.yaml
   ```

![Image 4](./assets/images/u8/image4.png)

- Did this force the system back into a working configuration?
  - If it worked, would it always work, or could they the system need to be
    manually intervened?
  - What is your test? (hint: `curl` 8080 8081 and 8082 from previous commands)
- Could this cause potential problems in the environment?
  - If so, is that problem based on technology or operational practices? Why?

### Digging Deeper challenge (not required for finishing lab)

1. Complete this lab: <https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Ansible-Labs/19-Ansible-csv-report>
   - Can you think about how you‚Äôd use this to verify that a system was stamped
     according to your build process?
     - You may have to tie it in with something like this lab and add some variables
       to your custom facts files, maybe the date of deployment:
       <https://killercoda.com/het-tanis/course/Ansible-Labs/12-Ansible-System-Facts-Grouping>

> Be sure to `reboot` the lab machine from the command line when you are done.

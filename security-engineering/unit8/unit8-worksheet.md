## Unit 8 Worksheet

## Instructions

Fill out this sheet as you progress through the lab and discussions. Hold your worksheets until
the end to turn them in as a final submission packet.


## Discussion Questions:

### Unit 8 Discussion Post 1:
Read about configuration management here:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_management>

* What overlap of terms and concepts do you see from this week’s meeting?

* What are some of the standards and guidelines organizations involved with
  configuration management?
    - TODO : ISO, ANSI (Anzy?), IEEE, change management

    1. Do you recognize them from other IT activities?

### Unit 8 Discussion Post 2:
Review the SRE guide to treating configurations as code. Read as
much as you like, but focus down on the “Practical Advice” section:
<https://google.github.io/building-secure-and-reliable-systems/raw/ch14.html#treat_configuration_as_code>

- What are the best practices that you can use in your configuration management adherence?
    - TODO: 

- What are the security threats and how can you mitigate them?

    - Why might it be good to know this as you design a CMDB or CI/CD pipeline?

   more useful change management practices and policies.


## Reflection Questions

1. How does the idea of control play into configuration management? Why is it so
important?

2. What questions do you still have about this week?

3. How are you going to use what you’ve learned in your current role?
